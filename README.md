# Portcat
Portcat is a lightweight, Python-based network monitoring and firewall tool. It allows you to see live network connections, block/unblock apps or IPs, and sort/filter connections.

## Features

- **Live Network Monitoring**: View all active connections with process name, PID, local and remote addresses, and status.  
- **Block / Unblock**: Easily block or unblock processes or IP addresses with a single click.  
- **Blocked / Unblocked Status**: Each connection shows `[BLOCKED]` or `[UNBLOCKED]`.  
- **Sorting Options**: Sort by newest → oldest, A → Z, or connection status (Established first).  
- **Filter by Blocked State**: Toggle between showing all connections, blocked only, or unblocked only.  
- **Modern UI**: Dark bubble-style interface, rounded buttons, and Chrome-style scrollbar.  
- **Auto-Refresh**: Connections update every second without disturbing your current sorting or filters.  
- **Cross-Platform Ready**: Works on Windows (requires admin rights to block/unblock IPs).
